## Overview:
This Designing an Enterprise Data Lake System project is part of the Data Architecture Nanodegree under the "Big Data Systems" chapter. The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable and efficient enterprise level data lake solution for a Medical Data Processing company. The goal for the system is to ingest, and process various datasets to support the big data analytics, data governance and business intelligence in the enterprise environment. My task is to design the architecture to handle both structured and unstructured data in this new proposed Data Lake solution. The system must support ingestion, transformation, storage and querying large volumes of data efficiently as the system scales. 

## Features:

- Orchestration Layer: Supporting task scheduling, allowing for automation with tools like Apache Airflow. 

- Ingestion Layer: Supports batch and real-time data ingestion pipelines using cloud-based services like Apache Kafka and Apache Nifi.

- Staging Layer: Staging data with services like Apache Presto.

- Processing Layer: Utilizes Apache Spark or Pyspark to process and transform data at scale.

- Serving Layer: Using tools like Apache Druid to serve the data to the proper endpoints like Tableau.

- Data Querying: Leverages Apache Presto for querying structured and semi-structured data using SQL-based queries.

## Project Structure:
The project contains the files below:

- Data_Lake_executive_presentation.pptx: Is the datalake value proposition presentation going over the summary of the prompt, going over data lake components, data lake architecture diagram, and the business value of the data lake.

- Data Lake Architecture Diagram.pdf: is the Data Lake Architecture diagram for the business proposal.

- Data Lake Architecture Design Document: is an extensive 12 page design document going over the business prompt of the EMRP company, the problems, customer/stakeholder frustration, business requirements, technical requirements, data lake design principles, risks, and the proposed data lake solution that will remedy and not only fix the current issues but handle possible future scaling issues.
